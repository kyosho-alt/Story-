Once upon a time there was a student studying engineering at MIT his name was Mitchell Drone, because hes always in the zone. 
Mitchell had the drive, but felt like he needed more direction in his life. One day, MIT had a career fair and one of the booths was a program called Year Up.
Mitchell then decided to join the Year Up program for a better oppurtunity. Throughout the program, Mitchell discovered he was quite 
intrested in coding. He learned many coding languages and learned how to build a professional brand. 
After succesfully completing the YearUp program, Mitchell was granted the opportunity to a 1 year contract with Microsoft.
